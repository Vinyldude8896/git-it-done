# Git-it-Done

### User Story

As a Developer, I want a web app that I can use to search different GitHub Profiles. When I load the application I should be presented witha search option to seach for a github  user by username. When I search a user, I shgould then be presented a list of their repositories. After searching for a GitHub user and having results returned, I would then like to filter by topic being JavaScript, HTML or CSS. If I click a repo, I should then see all of the outsanding issues for that repository.

### Features
This web application features a search tool, to search for a github user and see all of their repositories.
This application will allow a user to filter by topic after the search results have been returned.
This application also allows a user to click on any repo and see any outsanding issues for that repository
If a User clicks on the issue they will be directed to the github page for that issue.
